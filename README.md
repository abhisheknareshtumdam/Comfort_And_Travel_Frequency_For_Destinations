# **Travel Comfort and Frequency Analysis Post-Pendamic**

## Project Overview
This project analyzed the comfort levels and travel frequencies for various destinations (e.g., within a region, another province, internationally) once travel restrictions are lifted. The objective was to identify patterns in travelers' comfort levels across different trip frequencies (e.g., a few times a year, once a month) and understand the factors influencing their travel decisions.

## Tech Stacks
- **Microsoft Excel**: Used for data cleaning, organizing, and performing calculations.
- **Excel Formulas**: Utilized `AVERAGEIF`, `SWITCH`, and other functions to handle and analyze conditional data.
- **Data Visualization Tools** (if applicable): Used to visually present findings for better understanding and decision-making.

## Techniques Learned
- **Data Transformation**: Transformed qualitative responses into numerical values for easier analysis and actionable insights.
- **Conditional Aggregation**: Applied conditional functions like `AVERAGEIF` to calculate averages based on categories like comfort level and travel frequency.
- **Data Interpretation**: Identified trends and summarized insights that can inform business strategies, particularly in travel marketing.

## Business-Related Terms
- **Comfort Level**: The degree to which travelers are willing to engage in travel, categorized by timeframes like “ASAP” or “6 months.”
- **Travel Frequency**: Categories such as "A few times a year" or "Never," representing how often travelers typically engage in travel to certain destinations.
- **Regional and International Travel**: Differences in comfort levels regarding travel within local, national, and international destinations.

## Dataset Understanding
The dataset included categorical responses indicating the frequency of travel (e.g., “A few times a year”) and comfort levels (e.g., “6 months,” “ASAP”). The data required transformation into numerical values for more effective analysis, allowing insights into how travelers perceive comfort across different travel frequencies and destinations.

## Project Outcome
The analysis revealed that travelers are more comfortable with less frequent travel (e.g., once a year) within nearby regions. This insight can help travel-related businesses tailor their marketing strategies, offering solutions that align with customer preferences for travel frequency and destination proximity post-restrictions.
